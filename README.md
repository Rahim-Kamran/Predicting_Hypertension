# Hypertension Risk Prediction AI

Machine learning model for accurate hypertension staging with 97.7% accuracy

## üîç Project Overview
This project develops a *stacked ensemble machine learning model* to predict hypertension stages with clinical-grade accuracy. Key achievements:
- *97.7% overall accuracy* (outperforming single models by 25-30%)
- *100% recall for Stage 2 hypertension* - critical for preventing missed diagnoses
- *Interpretable AI* with clinically meaningful features (BMI-Stress interaction, Lifestyle Score)

## üèÜ Key Features
- *Advanced Model Architecture*: Stacked ensemble combining Random Forest, SVM, and logistic regression
- *Clinical Interpretability*: 
  - Feature importance analysis revealing top predictors
  - Decision tree visualization of splitting logic
- *Practical Implementation*:
  - EHR-compatible outputs
  - Probability thresholds optimized for clinical safety
